# Monty Hall Problem: simulation and resolution using Quantum Computing

This repo has two notebooks done for the hackaton assoaciated to the 'Qiskit Fall Fest en espa√±ol 2023'. Named as Paradox, our team won in second place the Hackaton, receiving recognition from IBM Quantum.

The goal of the hackaton was creating a project where Qiskit was used. Our project consist on:

1. a first notebook that shows how can we use quantum computing to simulate the probabilities of the classical algorithm for solving Monty Hall problem.
2. a second notebook that shows a new algorithm that increase the probability of success in comparison to the classical algorithm. While the clasical algorithm has a fixed probability of succes of 66%, our algorithm has a succes probability of, at least, 99.7%.
